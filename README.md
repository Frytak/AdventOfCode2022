# AdventOfCode2022

## What is it
I participated in the [Advent of Code in 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about) which is an "Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.".

## Why do it
For fun and a little bit of challange! By doing this advent calendar I can learn a lot about programming and problem solving, that is why I want to paticipate

## Goals
You can choose any language you like to solve these puzzles. For this years Advent of Code I am going to use [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) so I can enchance my skills a little bit more. Each solution will be in it's own folder with a README file containing the task of a puzzle and a link to it.
