# Advent Of Code 2022

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about) is an "Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other".

I wanted to participated for fun and a little bit of a challange! By doing this advent calendar I could learn a lot about programming and problem solving which is a great opportunity for me.

You can choose any programming language you like to solve these puzzles so that's why for this years Advent of Code I am going to use [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) so I can enchance my skills in it a little bit more.

Each solution will be in it's own folder with a README file containing the task of a puzzle with a link to it and my answer which is hidden so no worries, you won't get the solution by accident if you don't want to see it and participate yourself!
